   - Choose a location (e.g., `C:\Training`).
   - In the **File name** box, type `EmployeeTrainingTracker.xlsx`.
   - Click on **Save**.

### Step 2: Set Up the UiPath Project

1. **Open UiPath Studio**:
   - Click on the **Start** menu or press the **Windows key**.
   - Type **UiPath Studio** and press **Enter** to launch it.

   - In the **Location** box, choose where you want to save the project (e.g., `C:\UiPathProjects`).
   - Click **Create**.

### Step 3: Design the Workflow

1. **Open the Main.xaml File**:
   - In the **Project panel**, double-click on `Main.xaml` to open the workflow designer.

2. **Add Excel Application Scope**:
   - In the **Activities panel** (usually on the left side), search for **Excel Application Scope**.
   - Drag and drop the **Excel Application Scope** onto the designer canvas.

3. **Set the Excel File Path**:
   - Click on the **Excel Application Scope** box.
   - In the **Properties panel** (usually on the right), find the **WorkbookPath** property.
   - Click on the folder icon to browse and select your Excel file (`C:\Training\EmployeeTrainingTracker.xlsx`).

4. **Read Data from Excel**:
   - Inside the **Excel Application Scope**, search for **Read Range** in the Activities panel.
   - Drag and drop the **Read Range** activity inside the Excel Application Scope.
   - In the **Properties panel**, set:
     - **Output**: Create a new variable called `dtEmployeeData` (click on the `+` button to create a new variable).
     - **Range**: Leave this empty to read the entire sheet.

5. **Add For Each Row Activity**:
   - Below the **Read Range** activity, search for **For Each Row** in the Activities panel.
   - Drag and drop the **For Each Row** activity onto the designer canvas.
   - In the **Properties panel**, set the **DataTable** property to `dtEmployeeData`.

6. **Inside For Each Row, Check Completion Status**:
   - Drag and drop an **If** activity inside the **For Each Row**.
   - In the **Condition** box, enter:
     ```plaintext
     (row("Completion Status").ToString = "Not Started" Or row("Completion Status").ToString = "In Progress") And DateTime.Parse(row("Deadline").ToString) < DateTime.Now.AddDays(3)
     ```
   - This checks if the employee's training is not started or in progress and if the deadline is approaching.

7. **Send Email Reminders**:
   - Inside the **Then** section of the **If** activity, search for **Send SMTP Mail Message** in the Activities panel.
   - Drag and drop it into the **Then** section.
   - Set the properties:
     - **To**: Set to the employee's email (you may need to add a column for email addresses in your Excel file).
     - **Subject**: Type `Training Reminder for ${row("Training Course")}`.
     - **Body**: Type `Dear ${row("Employee Name")},\n\nThis is a reminder for your training course: ${row("Training Course")}.\nDeadline: ${row("Deadline")}.\n\nBest regards,\nYour HR Team`.

8. **Generate Weekly Report**:
   - After the **For Each Row**, you can create logic to generate the report. This involves creating a new DataTable to aggregate the data.
   - You can use **Write Range** to write the report data into a new Excel file or sheet.

9. **Send Report to HR**:
   - After generating the report, use the **Send SMTP Mail Message** activity again to send the report to HR.

### Step 4: Testing

1. **Run the Workflow**:
   - Click on the **Run** button (the green play button) in the toolbar to execute your workflow.
   - Check the output to ensure that reminders are sent correctly.

### Step 5: Deployment (Optional)

1. **Publish the Project**:
   - Once everything is tested and working, you can publish your project to UiPath Orchestrator (if you have access).
